# Primitive Data Types vs References Types

## Primitive Data Types

Stored directly in the location the variable accesses
Stored on the stack

## Reference Data Types

Accesses by reference
Objects that are stored on the heap
A pointer to a location in memory

## Primitive Data Types

    * String
    * Number (includes float, int, decimal, long, short)
    * Boolean
    * Null
    * Undefined
    * Symbols (ES6)

## Reference Data Types / Objects

    * Arrays
    * Object Literals
    * Functions
    * Dates
    * Anything else

## Dynamically Typed Language

    * Types are asociated with values not variables
    * The same variable can hold multiple types
    * We do not need to specify types
    * Most of other languages are statically typed (Java, C#, C++)
    * There are supersets of JS and addons to allow static typing(TypeScript, Flow)
